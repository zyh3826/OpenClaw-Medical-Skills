## What Is This?

**OpenClaw Medical Skills** is a curated collection of **869 AI agent skills** covering the full spectrum of biomedical and clinical research. These skills are designed for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/MedClaw-Org) / [NanoClaw](https://github.com/MedClaw-Org) — Claude-based personal AI assistant frameworks — and transform a general-purpose AI agent into a powerful medical and scientific research companion.

Each skill is a self-contained module (a `SKILL.md` file) that:
- Teaches the agent specialized domain knowledge and workflows
- Connects to real databases, APIs, and computational tools
- Produces structured, clinically or scientifically relevant outputs

> We benefit from the open-source community. The full collection of resources can be found here: [Awesome LLM Resources](https://github.com/WangRongsheng/awesome-LLM-resources?tab=readme-ov-file#%E6%8A%80%E8%83%BD-Skills)

### Why This Collection Matters

| Without Skills | With OpenClaw Medical Skills |
|---|---|
| Generic AI responses about medicine | Real PubMed / ClinicalTrials.gov / FDA queries |
| No bioinformatics capability | RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, GWAS, variant calling pipelines |
| No drug intelligence | ChEMBL, DrugBank, DDI prediction, pharmacovigilance |
| No clinical documentation | SOAP notes, discharge summaries, prior auth decisions |
| No genomics support | VCF annotation, ACMG classification, PRS calculation |
| No regulatory guidance | FDA, CE mark, IEC 62304, ISO 14971 compliance |

This collection aggregates skills from **12+ open-source skill repositories** spanning academic research tools, clinical workflows, regulatory frameworks, and cutting-edge AI-driven protein design — giving your AI agent capabilities comparable to a team of specialized research scientists.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) installed and running, **or** [NanoClaw](https://github.com/MedClaw-Org) as an alternative
- Git (for cloning this repo)

---

### For OpenClaw Users

OpenClaw loads skills from two locations:

| Priority | Path | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| High | `<workspace>/skills/` | Per-workspace (recommended) |
| Low | `~/.openclaw/skills/` | Global, shared across all agents |

#### Method 1 — Clone and Copy (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/MedClaw-Org/OpenClaw-Medical-Skills.git

# Install to your workspace skills directory
cp -r OpenClaw-Medical-Skills/skills/* <your-workspace>/skills/

# Or install globally (available to all agents)
cp -r OpenClaw-Medical-Skills/skills/* ~/.openclaw/skills/
```

Skills are picked up automatically on the next session. No restart needed.

#### Method 2 — ClawHub CLI

If you use the [ClawHub registry](https://clawhub.com), you can search and install individual skills from there. For bulk install from this collection, Method 1 is faster.

```bash
npm install -g clawhub
clawhub install <skill-slug>    # install a single skill
clawhub update --all            # update all installed skills
```

#### Method 3 — Configure Extra Directories

To point OpenClaw at a cloned copy of this repo permanently, add it to `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "load": {
      "extraDirs": ["/path/to/OpenClaw-Medical-Skills/skills"]
    }
  }
}
```

This mounts the entire collection without copying files.

#### Method 4 — Install Selected Skills Only

Pick skills relevant to your domain:

```bash
# Example: clinical + drug discovery stack
SKILLS=(
  "clinical-reports"
  "tooluniverse-drug-research"
  "tooluniverse-pharmacovigilance"
  "clinicaltrials-database"
  "biomedical-search"
  "tooluniverse-drug-drug-interaction"
)

for skill in "${SKILLS[@]}"; do
  cp -r OpenClaw-Medical-Skills/skills/$skill ~/.openclaw/skills/
done
```

---

### For NanoClaw Users

NanoClaw loads skills into agent containers at startup from `container/skills/`.

```bash
# Clone and copy into NanoClaw container skills directory
git clone https://github.com/MedClaw-Org/OpenClaw-Medical-Skills.git
cp -r OpenClaw-Medical-Skills/skills/* /path/to/nanoclaw/container/skills/

# Rebuild the container to apply
cd /path/to/nanoclaw
./container/build.sh
```

---

### Verification

After installation, ask your agent:

```
What medical and clinical skills do you have available?
```

Your agent should list the installed skills with their capabilities.
